I'm Alex, I'm a software engineer in Prestatech GmbH. Half of experience worked as engineer and half of manager from startups to middle-sized and big-tech companies.

I know developers feel doubts of choosing the IC role over a manager or vice versa. I'll tell about my own road how to find own purpose doing things I like

Who am I now?

And now I don't see

Leadership.

How do I see myself in 5 years? I don't know. Distinguished eng.

We have different roads to tech. Mine started in childhood many years ago with захватывающего C and C++ and PHP for web development.

It was childhood and fun.

When we grew we loose this fun, because now we are adult.

Sometimes we can choose money or career growth to management. No worries. It's okay.

Does my work make me fun? What things I need to remove or change?

When something is fun, it will persist for so much longer than something you're just doing to get a result.

Use directions and experiments, not long-term goals.


Every time write down what have you done. Don't remember, write it down.


What lessons can I make from these things and less succesful things?

Purpose: how can you find it? No one can apply it to you. Only experiments, inspect, adapt.
