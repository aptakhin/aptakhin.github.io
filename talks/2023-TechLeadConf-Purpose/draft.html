Title: What did I understand after two step-outs from being a team leader
Purpose: What I Learned from Stepping Down as Team Lead Twice.

We are very important to ourselves. Good motivation and appropriate context are very important for our impact. It is my own road to becoming and stepping down as team leader twice. It is one of a thousand ways to find motivation and purpose. I share part of my experience starting from the story of failures to a more ​​conscious vision of things that drive me and what I want to do. And I try to uncover why experimenting and making fun are the same important things as learning or communication skills.

Intended for software engineers and team leaders who have doubts about choosing the next step.


What interests you in speaking at this conference?
It’s a top-level conference dedicated to senior and management positions. I understand I have no huge public speaking experience required, but I desire to prepare an inspiring short talk.

How is your talk relevant to our audience?
I think it might be interesting to share doubts experience of choosing the IC role over a manager or vice versa. And to underline there is no wrong choice in any combination.

Rest
Learning

Did I do my best at this point of my understanding?

Accept my current state. And then go next.

Mentors. Who helped me. Supervisors, my mentors, communities, colleagues, friends. I calculated 6 closest people, and t

I do things I love and also company pays me money.


Forgive yourself for not knowing. Rezanova.

Communicating skills.
Я тут раздумывал почему злился в целом на последние сообщения после объявления Марьяны. Причем не на сами случаи, их могу понять как они могли произойти и иногда порадоваться, что у меня так не было (зато было по-другому ухаха). А злился на сообщения о случаях.

И понял что болезненно в моём случае. Каждый мой уход из каждой компании был связан с коммуникацией. Да, также там было и про новые возможности, но вот про коммуникацию было всегда. С каждой моей сменой работы я доходил всё дальше, чему очень способствовали люди вокруг меня.

И в прогрессе встаёт на место, что здоровая коммуникация она про диалог. С обеих сторон. Насколько думаю про точку зрения другой стороны. И что думает другая стороная про мою точку зрения. И я не отвечаю полностью за коммуникацию с другой стороны. Я могу только отрефлексировать свои решения.

И здесь мне кажется важный момент про принятие ответственности за решение. Ответственность за решение я остаюсь в компании в данный момент потому что двоеточие: перечисление некоторого списка из преимуществ, которые я получаю (и это не всегда про деньги) или я выбираю опцию другой компании или другой сферы деятельности.

Keep experimenting.

Long road to searching motivation and purpose.
What really motivates me: Mastery, Purpose, Autonomy

Keep experimenting. You can’t find the answer.

When and then is’t mess of misunderstanding.
Job is the contract from two sides. You try, you learn, keep doing. Don’t forget to take rest.
But sometimes you need to go next door.



2020 burning out,


I’ve just asked for trying to be team leader.

It’s a huge gap between being promoted and to be good enough for role.

//
First vacation, COVID restrictions. I’ve spent weeks just lying down and playing Playstation. No power for anything else.

Go rest.

You are a good engineer? Okay now try to be a good manager too!

History of failures and self-blaming. But then I sat down and try to find better lessons and
Responsiblity. Did I do my best at this point of my understanding?
Yes
