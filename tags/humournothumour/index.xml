      <description>I’m sure busy calendars open vast opportunities to choose one things over the others.
The more people in our department, the busier our calendar, the more valuable we are in terms of power to the company. It’s inappropriate if anyone can see our free calendar and book a meeting for us to discuss something urgent. 15 minutes on Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. in two weeks sounds fine.
It&amp;rsquo;s easier to add more processes. When there is no slack time, it’s much easier to conduct meetings without agendas and facilitate the decision-making process to continue in two weeks. Remember, there is no space in the current week because of meetings. We are also late to one meeting because of the others, and there is no time for lunch. It’s tough work!</description>
